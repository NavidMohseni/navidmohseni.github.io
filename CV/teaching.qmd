### MATH 1700 - Modern Elementary Statistics
**Fall 2024**

Teaching this course was a highlight of my academic journey. My philosophy centered on making statistics engaging and relatable to students' everyday lives, transforming a subject often viewed with trepidation into one of intrigue.

To bridge the gap between theory and reality, I introduced a **"Stat of the Day"** segment using data from platforms like *Statista*, covering topics from Black Friday consumer behavior to biomedical statistics. I also utilized creative examples—such as comparing gameplay statistics from *"Grand Theft Auto V"* vs. *"Call of Duty: Warzone"*—to demonstrate hypothesis testing in a fun context.

I prioritized inclusive support by offering extended office hours and collaborating with the Lemons Center tutors. This approach yielded exceptional engagement; I received outstanding feedback on *RateMyProfessor*, with students noting that the course successfully connected statistics to their own fields of study, such as nursing and engineering.

### Statistical Methods
**Spring 2023, Fall 2023, Spring 2024**

Over three semesters, I supported diverse cohorts of students under different professors, adapting my teaching style to match specific pedagogical methods. My primary goal was to demystify complex statistical concepts through accessible explanations.

I developed a strong rapport with my students, resulting in high attendance at office hours and a supportive learning environment. This connection was so effective that students frequently requested I TA for their future courses and invited me to academic ceremonies. I consistently received positive feedback from faculty regarding the improved performance and confidence of the students I mentored.

### Calculus 1
**Spring 2025, Fall 2025**

In this role, I assisted undergraduate students in mastering fundamental calculus concepts. Recognizing that Calculus is a gateway course that can be challenging, I focused on creating a low-stress environment where students felt safe making mistakes and learning from them.

I worked closely with the professors to align my recitation sessions with lecture material, ensuring continuity for the students. My approach emphasized clarity and patience, leading to strong student-TA relationships and commendations from the course instructors for my reliability and ability to handle student questions effectively.
