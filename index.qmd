## Bio

Hi there, I'm **Navid**.

I believe that data is more than just numbers; it is a tool to craft tangible help and impact lives. It is incredibly fulfilling to know that my work plays a part in assisting others and solving real-world problems.

Currently, I am immersing myself in the intricate world of **Computational Mathematics and Statistics** as a Ph.D. student at [Marquette University](https://www.marquette.edu/).

Previously, I earned my Master's degree in **Biostatistics** from [Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences](https://en.sbmu.ac.ir/index.jsp?fkeyid=&siteid=256&pageid=2046) (ranked 1st in the country for biostatistics), where my thesis focused on *cure rate survival models using discrete frailty*. I also hold a Bachelor's degree in **Statistics** from [Shahid Beheshti University](http://en.sbu.ac.ir/SitePages/Home.aspx).

In the professional realm, I navigate the intersection of research and application. I have worked as an independent data analyst, a researcher, and an instructor teaching R. My time at [TezolMarket](https://www.tezolmarket.com/) was particularly pivotal, allowing me to tackle and resolve complex data challenges on a daily basis.

Beyond the numbers, I have a deep-seated interest in [photography](https://500px.com/p/Navidmohseni?view=photos), [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54321599-navid-mohseni), running, squash, and art.
